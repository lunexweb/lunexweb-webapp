# File Uploader & ZIP Creator

This SvelteKit application now includes a powerful file uploader with drag-and-drop functionality and ZIP file creation capabilities.

## Features

✅ **Drag & Drop File Upload** - Simply drag files from your computer and drop them onto the upload area
✅ **Multiple File Support** - Upload multiple files at once
✅ **File Management** - View file names, sizes, and remove unwanted files
✅ **ZIP Creation** - Download all files as a single ZIP archive
✅ **Client-Side Processing** - All file handling happens in your browser (no server uploads)
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

1. **Upload Files**: Drag and drop files or click to browse and select multiple files
2. **Review & Organize**: See all your files listed with names, sizes, and file types
3. **Create ZIP**: Click "Download as ZIP" to create and download a compressed file

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `jszip` - For creating ZIP files on the client side
- `@types/jszip` - TypeScript definitions

### Components Created
- `FileUploader.svelte` - Main file upload component with drag-and-drop
- `src/routes/file-uploader/+page.svelte` - Demo page showcasing the functionality

### Key Features
- HTML5 Drag and Drop API
- File API for handling multiple file types
- JSZip for client-side ZIP creation
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Event-driven architecture with Svelte

## Netlify Deployment

This functionality works perfectly on Netlify because:

1. **Client-Side Only**: All file processing happens in the user's browser
2. **No Server Requirements**: No need for server-side file handling
3. **Static Site Compatible**: Can be deployed as a static site
4. **No API Keys**: No external service dependencies

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `.svelte-kit/output/client`
   - Deploy!

3. **Environment Variables**: None required for file uploader functionality

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## File Type Support

The uploader supports all file types:
- Images (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, etc.)
- Documents (PDF, DOC, TXT, etc.)
- Videos (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)
- Archives (ZIP, RAR, 7Z, etc.)
- Any other file type

## Security & Privacy

- **No File Uploads**: Files never leave the user's computer
- **Client-Side Processing**: All ZIP creation happens locally
- **No Server Storage**: No files are stored on any servers
- **Privacy First**: User data remains completely private

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```svelte
<script>
  import FileUploader from '$lib/FileUploader.svelte';
  
  function handleFilesSelected(event) {
    console.log('Files selected:', event.detail.files);
  }
  
  function handleZipCreated(event) {
    console.log('ZIP created:', event.detail.zipBlob);
  }
</script>

<FileUploader 
  on:filesSelected={handleFilesSelected}
  on:zipCreated={handleZipCreated}
/>
```

### Custom Event Handling
```svelte
<FileUploader 
  on:filesSelected={handleFilesSelected}
  on:zipCreated={handleZipCreated}
  on:error={handleError}
/>
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Large files are processed in memory
- **File Size Limits**: Browser-dependent (typically 2-4GB total)
- **ZIP Generation**: Scales with file count and size
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized for touch devices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Files not dropping**: Ensure the drop zone is visible and not covered by other elements
2. **ZIP not downloading**: Check browser download settings and popup blockers
3. **Large file errors**: Some browsers have file size limits

### Browser Console Errors
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser developer tools
- Ensure JSZip library is properly loaded
- Verify file input permissions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- File preview for images and documents
- Progress bars for large file processing
- Custom ZIP file naming
- File compression options
- Cloud storage integration (optional)

## Support

For issues or questions about the file uploader functionality:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Test with different file types and sizes
4. Ensure proper SvelteKit setup

**Note**: This file uploader is designed for client-side use and does not require any backend services or API keys. It's perfect for static site deployments on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
